# Facial-Expression-Recognition
A deep learning-based application to detect human emotions from facial expressions using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

# Important Libraries
This project utilizes the following libraries:

OpenCV: For face detection and real-time video processing.

TensorFlow/Keras: To build and train the emotion classification model.

NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and visualization.

tqdm: To display progress bars during training or loading data.

# Highlights
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Trained on facial emotion datasets to recognize emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, and more.

Real-Time Face Detection: Uses Haar Cascades to locate faces from webcam input for emotion classification.

Visualization with OpenCV: Detected emotions are displayed live over facial regions in a video frame.

# Requirements
Make sure the following are installed on your system:

Python 3.8 or higher

Jupyter Notebook

opencv-contrib-python

tensorflow

keras

pandas

numpy

tqdm

# Usage
Open Emotion detector1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Execute the cells step-by-step.

The webcam will activate and start detecting your emotions in real-time.
